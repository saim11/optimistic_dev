	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: Fixed one lookup table mistake, and a couple of glpyh
		omissions, that Harshula pointed out.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Sans: Applied Daniel Johnsons improvement to capital Eng to Sans, as
	described in previous commits.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Coptic: added alphabet to bold.  Accent marks not working -- a mystery.
	Some tweeks in medium face as well.
	
	glyph cleanup -- points too close, some glyphs outside bounding boxes.

2010-09-17 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: tightened up left side of na and derivatives.
	tighened up left sides of u, lla, na, dha, ndha, nya, jnya
	tightened up some of the vowel conjuncts, and left side of nna.

2010-09-16 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Coptic: fiddled about with letter forms, striving for a kind of
	consistency.
	
	Sinhala: Harshula noticed four incorrect combined forms.  Fixed these.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Latin Extended-A: Applied Daniel Johnson's patch that made two versions
	of capital Eng.  His explanation:
		'
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8A
	
		The form of capital Eng currently in all three FreeFont faces
		is that used by the Sami people, resembling a capital N with a
		hooked right descender.
		However, the form preferred for African and Amerindian
		languages resembles a tall lowercase n with a hook that almost
		meets the left vertical.  (See wikipedia link above for a
		visual.)
	
		Recommend moving the existing Sami-style Eng to a PUA or
		non-Unicode slot, creating African-style Eng at U+014A, and
		adding a LOCL table with substitution rules for
		Inari Sami (ISM), Lule Sami (LSM),
		Northern Sami (NSM) and Skolt Sami (SKS).
		'
	Latin Extended-B: Also in his patch:
		added U+0220 (Latin Capital Letter N with long leg)

2010-09-15 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Latin for Sami: Daniel Johnson's patch added alternative form of Eng for
		African languages and a 'local' table for the Sami form.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: regularized kundaliya a bit.
	re-named a few more ligature glyphs, for consistency

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Put stray lookup into its proper subtable.

	Gurmukhi: improved some names of ligature glyphs, and found one
	apparently doubled table entry (kagurmukhi_nuktagurmukhi.nukt  now 
	gur_ka.nukt)

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Various measures to fix problems FontForge Find Problems reports under
	ATT, including a mass glyph rename of Sinhala ligatures.

	Control Pictures: added a bunch (but... is it worth it?)

2010-09-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Buginese: lookup tables and glyphs to re-order vowels, courtesy of
	          Mohammad Anwari.

	Sinhala: complete replacement of range with glyphs extracted more
	directly from Yannis Haralambous' sinha TeX font (last version was
	also derived from this font, but had undergone detrimental processing).
	Implements "rak" glyphs using three GSUB lookup steps.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Osmanya: courtesy of Daniel Johnson.

	Note this script is slanted in every sample I've seen.  That is
	justification enough that the glyphs in this range look slated,
	although the face isn't oblique.

	UCAS Extended: by Daniel Johnson

2010-09-05 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fix for FontForge warning (v 20090923)
	
	"On Windows many apps will have problems with this font's kerning,
	because because 58 of its glyph kern pairs cannot be mapped to
	unicode-BMP kern pairs"
	
	This was due to kern tables for the Musical Symbols range, which isn't
	in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.
	
	Removed this lookup.  Might consider another way to position these
	symbols.

2010-08-30 Stevan_White

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Resolves class of validation problems in Sinhala: Bad Glyph Name.
	
	This is a FontForge bug, that appears when certain types of problems
	occur in the glyph contours.  Probably an arithmetic error causes some
	corruption.

	Corrected missing extrema in recent Latin Extended-D range

	Sinhala: re-did previous patch using a more recent one.
	Un-did some other glyph changes that didn't help much anyway.

	* FreeMono.sfd:
